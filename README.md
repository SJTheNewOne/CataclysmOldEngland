# CataclysmOldEngland
Middle-ages themed mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead.
To use, pick your favoured one: the Magicalysm one REQUIRES Magiclysm, the innawoods one REQUIRES innawoods, set them up in your mod folder, make a new world, and pick 'Medieval Times' as the scenario - it completely replaces "Challenge - Medieval Peasant" and includes the old 'Churl' profession, and six new ones. 
Designed on 0.H Stable. Made as first mod, with hopes to expand it into something much bigger than this.
