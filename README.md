# CataclysmOldEngland
Middle-ages themed mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead.
To use, pick your favoured one: the Magicalysm one REQUIRES Magiclysm, the innawoods one REQUIRES innawoods, set them up in your mod folder, make a new world, and pick 'Medieval Times' as the scenario - it completely replaces "Challenge - Medieval Peasant" and includes the old 'Churl' profession, and six new ones.
